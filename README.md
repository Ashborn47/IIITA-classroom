# IIITA-Classroom
IIITA Classroom is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a digital classroom environment. It implements robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure and role-based access control for different types of users.

Features
1. Authentication System
Users can securely register, log in, and log out.
Sessions are managed using industry-standard secure methods such as JWT or OAuth.
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Three distinct roles:
Admin: Manages overall system configurations, user roles, and access permissions.
Professor (Moderator): Can upload, edit, and manage classroom resources.
Student (User): Can access shared resources, view classroom content, and interact within authorized boundaries.
3. Authorization by Role
Access to application resources is strictly governed based on the user's role. This ensures a streamlined and secure experience for each user type.
